### PHYS4041 Project 2024/25

##### PROJECT 2: Quantum machine learning classification.

In this project we will perform and test quantum machine learning on the task of
classification. This will build on the code on Moodle for the MNIST handwritten digit
classification.

Main tasks
1. Modify code to perform binary classification on different pairs of digits.
2. Implement different methods for encoding the image data (using simulator)
3. Test and compare different depths for the ansatz circuit
4. Compare different methods for computing (or approximating) gradients

Further investigation
1. Perform binary classification using fashion MNIST
2. Implement multi-class classification
3. Run an optimised circuit on IBM device
